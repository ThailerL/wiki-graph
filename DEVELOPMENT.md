# Development Log

## Weeks 1 - 2

This week, we started by writing a script to morph our large dataset into a smaller subset of it based on some tolerances. 
Alongside this, the project subdirectory structure and Makefiles were also set up.
Furthermore, we implemented our graph data structure in C++ with the ability to load data, and set up the interface with some preliminary tests for the shortestPath algorithm.
