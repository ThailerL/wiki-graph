# Development Log

## Week 1

This week, we started by writing a script to morph our large dataset into a smaller subset of it based on some tolerances. 
Alongside this, the project subdirectory structure and Makefiles were also set up.
Furthermore, we implemented our graph data structure in C++ with the ability to load data, and set up the interface with some preliminary tests for the shortestPath algorithm.

# Week 2

T.B.D (Physics for force drawing & shortestPath)
