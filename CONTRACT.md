# Team Contract (tslietz2-sohamk2-ttz2)

## Communication
1. **Team Meetings** Our team will meet once a week on Tuesdays from 5-7 PM. Meetings will be held on Discord. Notes will be taken on subjects pertaining to progress made, problems/issues, goals, and work assignments. When a member brings up a point, they will be the one to take the related note in its designated section in a Google document.
2. **Assistance** Team members can communicate with each other through our discord group, and will usually be online to answer questions or give assistance. In addition, we will commit to responding to emails in a timely fashion.
3. **Respect** The ‘project lead’ for the weekly meeting will be decided by a rotation starting with tslietz2. Their role is to ensure that every member of the group has had a chance to speak or state their opinion about a design decision or any other topic related to the final project. All decisions will be accepted by simple majority—while unanimous agreement is preferred, it is not required. By signing this document, each member of the team commits to adhering to the decisions made, even if they personally disagree with them.

## Collaboration
1. **Work Distribution** Necessary deliverables for each week will be decided and assigned at the team meeting for that week. Ideally assignments will be based on interest/ability and be decided unanimously, and conflicts will be resolved by compromising on a case by case basis, such as agreements on future work assignments or collaboration on a certain deliverable.  If someone has too much work, adjustments can be made to their assigned deliverables for that week.
2. **Time Commitment** In order to maintain the pace of the project, each member is expected to work two to six hours per week under normal conditions. If an issue arises or if a task ends up taking a significantly larger amount of time than expected, they will communicate with the rest of the team and state what problems they are facing, and work will be re-budgeted to split the load if needed. In order to meet project deadlines, more work may be occasionally needed but will be split across team members.
3. **Conflict Resolution** 3 people conflicts within this group will be resolved by a simple vote, where the majority prevails. In case of 2 people conflicts, the 3rd person will serve as a tie-breaking vote.
